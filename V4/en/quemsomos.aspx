    The Pysi is an interesting name. It means a lot of things, but with the head at
    the right place. With Pysi, we wanted to say the life is controlled by the reason,
    by the mind. Psi is the Greek word that influenced our ideas, the word that symbolizes
    the mental knowledge.
    <br />
    <br />
    PSI is also a Portuguese acronym for “For Your Information” (Para Sua Informação).
    We work with Information Technology. The data and the knowledge control must be
    at your hand and your company’s hand. The Pysi Desenvolvimento puts all your data
    “For Your Information”, legible and simple.
    <br />
    <br />
    And Pysi, itself, means “Put Your Software Inside”. It’s join of the previous ideas,
    and the fact that we work with IT. If you have a problem and technology may help
    you, Pysi puts your software inside, working. At Pysi, we transform ideas in reality,
    problems in solutions, organization in action. Our focus are personalized projects
    for people, small and big organizations.
